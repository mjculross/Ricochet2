Ricochet2: a very simplistic watchface without being boring

[ SDK 2.0 compatible version ]

Time & day/date float around the screen (a la Roomba style)
   in a semi-random fashion, "bouncing" off the edges of the
   screen & "ricocheting" off of each other. 

NOTE: to allow full use of the buttons, ScrSaver
   loads in as an app (at the same menu level
   as "Settings" on the Pebble), not as a
   watchface . . . it just displays a watchface

Features (v 2.0):
- selectable white-on-black or black-on-white display
- selectable date-on-top or time-on-top display mode
- selectable 12/24 hour format time
- selectable mm/dd/yy or dd/mm/yy format date
- preference settings are maintained in persistent storage

Operating instructions:
- to toggle between black-on-white & white-on-black
  displays, long-press the "select" button
- to toggle between date-on-top & time-on-top display
  mode, double-click the "select" button (also freezes the
  display for 4-seconds)
- to toggle between 12/24 hour format time, press the
  "down" button
- to toggle between mm/dd/yy & dd/mm/yy date format, press
  the "up" button
- to turn backlight on/off (automatically turns off after
  4-seconds), either press "select" button, or tap/shake
  (also freezes the display for 4-seconds)
